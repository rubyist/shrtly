Welcome to shrt.ly!

## Setup

shrt.ly is a standard Phoenix app, using the following versions:

elixir 1.12.3
erlang 24.0.3
phoenix 1.6.2

The only external dependency is the postgres database.
To configure the database, just ensure the credentials on `config/dev.exs` are correct.

The standard make targets can then be used:

`make setup`
`make test`
`make server`

## Design

The design is pretty straight forward. It relies on a Postgres sequence to generate
a sequence of integers that each URL record can use. When the next sequence has been
retrieved, we binary encode the integer value and run it through a base 64 encoder.
This gives us reasonably small slugs for a large number of URLs in a URL safe character
set.

For an even better time, I've provided a fun encoder that generates slugs using a set
of emoji faces, because why not!?
